    This is a placeholder text for actual abstract - NLTK, the Natural Language Toolkit,
    is a suite of open source program
    modules, tutorials and problem sets,
    providing ready-to-use computational
    linguistics courseware. NLTK covers
    symbolic and statistical natural language
    processing, and is interfaced to
    annotated corpora. Students augment
    and replace existing components, learn
    structured programming by example,
    and manipulate sophisticated models
    from the outset.
